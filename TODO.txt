1. Problem - we shouldn't have to pushing and pulling to update prompts.
- maybe we store the prompts in Notion? Airtable?
- maybe we use FastHTML, deploy with Railway and just build our own prompt library UI?

2. Inject global resources into prompts from both the prompt library and the column description.
- if it's an @ with a URL, then get the contents of that URL and inject it (like Cursor)
